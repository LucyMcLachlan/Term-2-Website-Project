    <p>
        The magic of Skylands is replensished every hundred year by the four elementals who cause a giant magical volcanoe 
        to explode. But after the skylanders the protectors of Skylands get thrown to earth by the explosion of the volcanoe they're given the power to swap their
        top and bottom halfs with other skylanders expanding their powers. Using these new powers the skylanders must stop Kaos our (small goblin like) 
        main villain from turning the elementals evil with his evil magic and then get back to Skylands.

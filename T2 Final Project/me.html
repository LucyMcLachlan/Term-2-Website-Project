            This game has a really speacial place in my heart because it reminds me of people I don't really see anymore.
            When I used to play this game all the time with my old best friend when I lived in Calgary. 
            We'd spend hours just switching the tops and bottoms of the characters to see the most ridiculous one we could make.
            I don't think we even finished the game but just remembering the game brings me back to a time where I was around six or seven years old messing around with my best friend.
